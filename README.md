# Study-Homicide-Sucide-Rate-VS-Income

Welcome to my first project. In here you can find: the tables, the report and code used for this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to discover if there is any kind of correlation, link or relationship between the number of suicides and the number of homicides in the world depending on the income of the country.
